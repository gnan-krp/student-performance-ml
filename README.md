# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Description
This project predicts a student's final score based on study hours and attendance
using a simple machine learning algorithm (linear regression).

##  Concepts Used
- Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Basic data preprocessing
- Model prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Hours studied
- Attendance percentage
- Final score

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install NumPy
3. Run `model.py`
4. Enter hours and attendance when prompted

##  What I Learned
- How linear regression works
- Applying ML theory to real data
- Writing simple ML code from scratch
